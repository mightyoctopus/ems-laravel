To-Do List:

- To make pagination 

2. Add Success message upon a form submission -- DONE

3. Implement database rendering on the homepage -- DONE

4. Implement Edit functionality:
   - function edit: blade template left to do -DONE
   - MVC for update left to do - DONE
   - previous filed values to be appearing -- DONE 
   - redirects to the home when editing is completed successfully -- DONE

Relational Database Integration:

1. Re-touch the UPDATE Controller to handle both edit the basic profile and 

 - details info: create and edit 
DONE

2. Re-touch web.php -- DONE


3. Remove the Details info creation form in the Add Form -- DONE

4. enum blood type error on the edit form -- DONE 
(settled by normalizing the enum input value -- with trim and case insenstivity)

5. Submit error on the Edit page -- DONE
settled by removing required on blade view HTML and the custom Request(EmployeeDetailUpdateRequest.php)

The main reason removing required resolved the issue is that it made the fields optional. Validation no longer failed for missing fields, allowing the form submission to succeed. If you need those fields to be optional but still want validation when they are present, you can safely rely on rules like numeric, min:0, and Rule::in(...) without applying required.
